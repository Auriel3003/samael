**Diary Entry:**  

October 2nd, 2024  

Today did not unfold as planned, but that made it all the more memorable. Ali, Anas, Gyanesh, Nirbhay, Jiya, Prajakta, Shravya, and I set out for NIBM in Pune, indulging in a culinary adventure as we hopped between eateries. Midway, Anas suggested visiting Kitaabi Café, a cozy haven for book lovers.  

Upon arriving, we found an ongoing literature club lecture. Though unregistered, we quietly took a corner, immersing ourselves in books—encyclopedias, comics, and more—while chatting about life. The main highlight was Shravya’s mock test for her upcoming lecture on Radio Astronomy. Though her presentation was incomplete, we brainstormed ideas, discussed key points, and shared thoughts on science and philosophy.  

Time slipped away unnoticed, and after nearly five hours of discussions, we stepped out as twilight faded, cherishing an unexpectedly enriching day.  

**Astronomy Fact:**  

Radio astronomy allows us to study celestial objects beyond visible light. The first detected radio waves from space were from the Milky Way, leading to the discovery of radio galaxies, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation—key evidence of the Big Bang. Unlike optical telescopes, radio telescopes can operate day and night, revealing hidden cosmic phenomena.
