**Date: August 23, 2023**

**Location: Lecture Room no. 7, Sadguru Science Classes, Virar**

🌟 **Hello, fellow space enthusiasts!** 🚀

I'm absolutely thrilled to share the incredible experience of August 23, 2023, with all of you. On that unforgettable evening, we embarked on a journey celebrating India's scientific excellence at Sadguru Science Classes in Virar. The Antariksh - Astronomy Club of VI, in collaboration with the Astronomy Club of Vishwakarma Institutes, orchestrated a jaw-dropping live presentation of the Chandrayaan-3 lunar landing. This event brought together over 50 enthusiastic students, ranging from Class 8th to 12th.

The lecture room was buzzing with anticipation as Antariksh volunteers and four esteemed educators from Sadguru Science Classes flawlessly managed the event. The highlight of the evening was the live streaming of Chandrayaan-3's landing, offering us real-time footage from ISRO's Control Room. The atmosphere in the lecture hall mirrored the tension and excitement felt at ISRO's Control Room.

🌕 As the Chandrayaan-3's Vikram Lander delicately touched down on the lunar surface, cheers of joy, patriotic slogans, and tears of pride filled the room. The entire event served as a poignant reminder of the unbreakable spirit of human exploration and the unifying power of scientific achievements.

🙌 Undoubtedly, the success of this event owes much to the dedication and mentorship of Mr. Jameer Manur Sir, a respected figure in the field, currently serving at IUCAA in Pune, India. Jameer Sir's guidance was instrumental in making this event a resounding success. I must also applaud the tireless efforts of the Antariksh - Astronomy Club members, who worked tirelessly to bring this event to life, driven by their unwavering commitment and passion for showcasing the marvels of Indian Space Technology.

👏 None of this would have been possible without the unwavering support and encouragement of our Managing Directors, Mr. Ashok Sawant Sir and Mrs. Sanjokta Sawant Madam. Their visionary decision to collaborate with the Antariksh Club has undoubtedly ignited the flames of scientific pride and curiosity in the young minds present that evening.

🌌 A special shoutout to me, Sahil Sawant, a dedicated volunteer at the Antariksh Club and a Physics Teacher at Sadguru Science Classes. I had the privilege of acting as the vital link between the Antariksh - Astronomy Club and our classes, ensuring the seamless execution of the event. Additionally, I had the opportunity to deliver an informative lecture on Chandrayaan-3 to our Class 11th and 12th students, further enriching their educational experience in the realm of Physics.

🚀 The live presentation of Chandrayaan-3's lunar landing at Sadguru Science Classes is a testament to the power of collaborative efforts, education, and the innate curiosity of the human spirit. It has etched a milestone in India's scientific journey and left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of all those who witnessed this historic moment. Through events like these, we are paving the way for future generations to embrace the wonders of science and continue the legacy of exploration and discovery.

🌠 With scientific pride and a sense of wonder,
Sahil Sawant 🌌🪐🛰️🌠
