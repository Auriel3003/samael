# ðŸŒŸ Unforgettable star gazing experience with Antariksh Club! ðŸŒŸ

Recently, I had the privilege of attending a mesmerizing star gazing event organized by the Antariksh - Astronomy Club , under the expert guidance of Jameer Manur Sir. We ventured to the picturesque foothills of Rajgad Fort, nestled near Pune district, for an evening filled with celestial wonders.

Under the clear night sky, we had the opportunity to witness the beauty of Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Saturn, shining brightly in the vast cosmos. It was a surreal experience to gaze at these celestial bodies and marvel at their presence in the universe.

Immersing ourselves in the magical night, we explored constellations and delved into their captivating stories. The sky became our canvas, painting an awe-inspiring picture of cosmic wonders that sparked our curiosity and deepened our appreciation for the mysteries of the universe.

Adding to the enchantment of the evening, we danced around the bonfire, its warm glow illuminating our faces and creating a sense of camaraderie among all participants. The crackling flames provided the perfect backdrop as we shared laughter, stories, and forged lasting connections.

Astro photography was another highlight of the event, allowing us to capture the celestial spectacle and create tangible memories of this extraordinary night. Immersed in the beauty of the night sky, we embraced the joy of exploration and discovery.

What made the experience even more special was the celebration of our birthdays! My friend Sumit and I were touched by the heartfelt gestures of our club members. Chanchal Rathad, Bhavya Shah, Samiksha Gurakhe, Aditya, Harsh, Riddhi, Shreya, and our mentor Jameer Sir came together to make our day truly memorable, showering us with love, laughter, and warm wishes.

I am grateful to the Antariksh Club for organizing this incredible star gazing event, providing a platform for us to connect with the cosmos and each other. Special thanks to Jameer Manur Sir for his unwavering support and guidance, making this experience possible.
