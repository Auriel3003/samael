# Empowering Women through Technology: Our Journey at the Sanjay Ghodawat University Project Exhibition

## Introduction
üåü **Harnessing Technology to Fight Violence against Women: Our Project Journey** üåü

Participating in the Project Exhibition Competition at Sanjay Ghodawat University was a thrilling experience for me and my talented friends, Chanchal Rathad and Tayyab Shaikh. Under the invaluable guidance of Prof. Sangeeta Kurundkar, we embarked on a mission to create a project that addresses a critical issue plaguing our society: violence against women. With enthusiasm and determination, we developed a smart safety device that utilized the power of technology to empower women and ensure their security.

## The Project: "Fighting Violence against Women with Technology, a Smart Safety Device" üí™

Our project aimed to provide women with a reliable and discreet safety solution that could assist them during vulnerable situations. We combined the Raspberry Pi, a GPS module, and a surveillance camera to create a comprehensive system that could act as a virtual guardian.

The device we developed was compact, lightweight, and user-friendly. It allowed women to trigger an emergency alert by simply pressing a button. Once activated, the device would capture real-time footage through the surveillance camera and transmit it to a designated contact or emergency service, along with the precise GPS location. This instant communication ensured that help could reach the victim swiftly and efficiently, potentially deterring potential attackers and providing evidence for legal actions.

## The Project Exhibition: An Immersive Learning Experience üéì

Participating in the Project Exhibition at Sanjay Ghodawat University proved to be a remarkable opportunity for us to showcase our innovation and learn from other talented participants. The event was a vibrant platform where students from various disciplines gathered to display their creative projects and exchange knowledge.

We had the privilege to interact with like-minded individuals and receive valuable feedback from faculty members, industry professionals, and fellow students. The constructive criticism and insightful suggestions helped us refine our project and broaden our understanding of technology's impact on social issues.

Moreover, witnessing the diverse range of projects at the exhibition exposed us to an array of innovative ideas and inspired us to continue exploring technology's potential for societal betterment. It was truly a melting pot of creativity, ingenuity, and collaboration.

## Lessons Learned and Future Prospects üîç

Participating in the Project Exhibition competition at Sanjay Ghodawat University taught us valuable lessons that will resonate throughout our journey as aspiring technologists and social change advocates. Here are some key takeaways from our experience:

> 1. **The Power of Collaboration:** Working together as a team allowed us to combine our unique skills and perspectives, resulting in a stronger and more holistic project.
>
> 2. **Technology as a Catalyst for Change:** Our project demonstrated that technology, when harnessed purposefully, can play a vital role in addressing social issues and empowering marginalized communities.
>
> 3. **Continuous Learning:** Engaging with experts and fellow participants at the exhibition exposed us to new ideas and technological advancements, emphasizing the importance of staying curious and up-to-date with emerging trends.
>
> 4. **Impact beyond the Competition:** Our project was not just a competition entry but a stepping stone towards creating a tangible impact in society. We are committed to further refining and implementing our smart safety device to make a difference in the lives of women facing violence.

## Conclusion: Empowering Women, One Innovation at a Time üí´

The Project Exhibition competition at Sanjay Ghodawat University provided us with a platform to showcase our project and foster a deeper understanding of the potential of technology in addressing social issues. We are immensely grateful to Prof. Sangeeta Kurundkar for her guidance, our teammates Chanchal Rathad and Tayyab Shaikh for their unwavering support, and everyone who appreciated our endeavor.

Moving forward, we are determined to refine our project, explore avenues for collaboration, and strive towards making a meaningful impact in the fight against violence against women. Together, let's leverage technology to create a safer, more inclusive world for all. üíúüåç‚ú®
