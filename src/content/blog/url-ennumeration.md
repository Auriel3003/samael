# URL Enumeration of Hidden Servers over TOR

The exploration of the dark and hidden corners of the internet has always been a topic of intrigue and complexity. One of the fundamental elements in this domain is the ability to discover and enumerate URLs of hidden servers over the TOR network.

## Project Overview
This project, titled "URL Enumeration of Hidden Servers over TOR," delves into the methodology and techniques used to uncover URLs within the TOR network. With a focus on anonymity and privacy, this exploration is both intricate and essential.

## Objective
The primary aim of this project is to devise tools and techniques to catalog and explore hidden servers within the TOR network. By understanding the mechanisms behind these hidden URLs, we aim to shed light on the network's structure and uncover the breadth of content accessible through this anonymized gateway.

### Approach and Methodology
- **TOR Network Access**: Utilizing the TOR network to access and traverse hidden services.
- **Web Crawling and Scraping:** Employing web crawling tools to collect URLs and subdirectories.
- **Encryption Analysis:** Delving into the encryption methods used within TOR to understand their strengths and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Leveraging tools like Wireshark to capture and dissect network traffic for insights into URL dissemination.
- **Script Development and Analysis:** Crafting scripts in Python to automate tasks and analyze encrypted data for hidden URLs.

### Technology Stack
- **TOR:** The Onion Router for anonymous browsing and access to hidden services.
- **Python Scripting:** Automation and analysis of data and encryption.
- **Wireshark & Tcpdump:** Tools for network traffic analysis.
- **Cryptography Insights:** Understanding and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in encryption methods.

### Considerations and Challenges
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Adherence to legal boundaries and ethical usage of the tools.
- **Network Stability and Congestion:** Handling network congestion and ensuring stable access.
- **Cryptographic Challenges:** Understanding and working around encryption barriers.
- **Dynamic Nature of Hidden Services:** Constant adaptation to the ever-changing landscape of hidden URLs.

## Conclusion
"URL Enumeration of Hidden Servers over TOR" is an ongoing exploration into the intricate realm of hidden services within the TOR network. By combining technological tools with ethical considerations, this project aims to unravel the mysteries of this anonymized space while respecting privacy and legal boundaries.
