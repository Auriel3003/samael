### **2. Dr. Hansa Padmanaban's Lecture on Early Universe**

#### 2.1 Overview of the Universe's Early History
- **Age of the Universe**: 13.8 billion years old.
- **Focus Area**: The first billion years, when the first stars and galaxies formed, known as the "final frontier of cosmology."
- **Challenge**: This period is studied through **invisible light (radio frequencies)** since visible light was not yet present.

#### 2.2 Understanding the Scale of the Universe
- **Microphysics vs Cosmological Scales**:
  - **Microphysics**: Deals with very small scales, like protons.
  - **Cosmological scales**: Involves vast distances, such as galaxies.
- **Units of Measurement**:
  - **Light Year (ly)**: The distance light travels in a year.
  - **Parsec (pc)**: Another unit of distance; 1 parsec ≈ 3.26 light years.
  - **Scientific Notation**: 
    - \(10^{-8}\): Small scales (e.g., subatomic).
    - \(10^{16}\): One light year.
    - \(10^{22}\): Typical size of galaxies.

#### 2.3 Zooming Out: A Movie Visualization
- **Earth to Cosmic Scales**:
  - Satellite orbits, solar system, and nearby stars.
  - Galactic structures like the Milky Way and Andromeda (1 million light years away).
  - **Cosmic Horizon**: The farthest observable light, the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**, marking the universe's earliest light.

#### 2.4 The Expanding Universe
- **Hubble’s Discovery**: A relationship exists between a galaxy's speed and distance, supporting the concept of an **expanding universe**.
- **Redshift**: As galaxies move away, their light is stretched (red-shifted), showing increased distance and speed.

#### 2.5 Time and Observations in Cosmology
- **Observing the Past**: Light takes time to travel, so observing distant objects allows scientists to see their past states.
- **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**: A tool for studying distant objects and exploring the early universe.

#### 2.6 Evolution of the Universe: Key Milestones
1. **The Big Bang**: Universe's origin; unification of quantum mechanics and gravity.
2. **Formation of Atoms**: The first atoms formed from particles.
3. **Cosmic Dawn**: The first stars and galaxies lit up, ending the "Dark Ages" and beginning the "Cosmic Renaissance."
4. **Galactic Evolution**: Structure formation, including star clusters and galaxy clusters.
5. **Today**: Humans appear late in the cosmic timeline.
6. **Future**: Sun will evolve into a **red giant** in ~5 billion years.

#### 2.7 Key Insights
- The early universe holds the key to understanding cosmic origins.
- Technological advances, such as the **James Webb Space Telescope**, enable deeper exploration of the universe’s past.

#### 2.8 Conclusion
- The lecture provided an introduction to the universe's early history and explored key aspects of cosmic evolution, with a focus on the first billion years.

### **3. Lecture Notes: Dr. Hansa Padmanaban on Hydrogen and the Universe's Evolution**

#### 3.1 Exploring the Composition of the Universe
- **Dark Universe**:
  - **Dark Matter**: Indirectly inferred, not yet directly detected.
  - **Dark Energy**: Dominates ~70% of the universe, theorized to have negative pressure.
- **Ordinary Matter**: Comprises only 5% of the universe, mostly in the form of hydrogen and helium gases.
  - **Hydrogen**: Forms 92% of baryonic matter.

#### 3.2 Hydrogen and Cosmic Evolution
- **Reionization**: 
  - Hydrogen was initially neutral.
  - Ultraviolet (UV) light from early stars ionized hydrogen, splitting protons and electrons.
  - By 1 billion years after the Big Bang, overlapping ionized bubbles marked the completion of reionization.

#### 3.3 Observing Reionization
- **Quasars**: Bright, distant galaxy nuclei powered by black holes. Their light interacts with hydrogen, creating an absorption spectrum.
- **Challenges**: Observing faint galaxies responsible for reionization is difficult, and the JWST may miss crucial faint galaxies.

#### 3.4 21 cm Hydrogen Line
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Hydrogen atoms have two states of proton and electron spins (aligned or opposite).
- **21 cm Radiation**: Emission occurs when hydrogen transitions between these states.
- **Mapping Hydrogen**: 21 cm radiation is used to map hydrogen during the Cosmic Dawn and reionization.

#### 3.5 The Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
- **Overview**: A global radio telescope project in South Africa and Australia, covering an area of 1 square kilometer.
- **Goals**: Observing the early universe and Cosmic Dawn through 21 cm emissions and mapping hydrogen evolution.
- **Data Scale**: SKA will process **11 exabytes daily**, a scale that surpasses the entire global internet's data (2020).

#### 3.6 Conclusion
- Understanding hydrogen's evolution through techniques like **21 cm mapping** is crucial for studying the universe’s early phases.

### **4. Lecture Notes: Advances in Understanding the Universe – Dr. Hansa Padmanaban**

#### 4.1 The Immense Scale of Data in Modern Astronomy
- **Exabyte Scale**: The SKA will process data at the scale of 11 exabytes daily.
- **Context**: 1 exabyte equals \(10^{18}\) bytes—an immense amount of data, surpassing global internet traffic.

#### 4.2 First Detection of the Hydrogen Signal
- **2018 Experiment**: Initial detection of hydrogen signal at a redshift of 17 (around 300 million years after the Big Bang).
- **Indian-Led Counter-Experiment**: The detection was not confirmed due to possible instrumental effects.

#### 4.3 New Techniques in Observational Astronomy
- **Cross-Correlation**: Combining signals from multiple telescopes (radio + optical) to enhance reliability and reduce noise.
- **Example**: MeerKAT (radio) + Optical Telescopes.

#### 4.4 Carbon Monoxide (CO) Intensity Mapping
- **CO as a Star Formation Tracer**: CO molecules emit radiation that can trace star formation.
- **CO Mapping**: COMAP project measures CO emissions from redshifts \(z \sim 2–7\).

#### 4.5 Insights from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
- **JWST’s Findings**: Detection of unexpectedly bright and massive galaxies at early cosmic times.
- **Implications**: JWST observations challenge existing models of

 early galaxy formation.

#### 4.6 Cosmic Timeline and Current Understanding
- **Main Questions**: 
  - How did the universe evolve into its present state?
  - When did the first stars and galaxies form?

#### 4.7 Conclusion
- Dr. Padmanaban emphasized that with emerging technologies and collaborations (like the SKA and JWST), our understanding of the early universe is poised for significant advancement.
