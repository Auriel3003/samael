### Nightout at IUCAA  

The night of 21st August is one I'll cherish for years. Lavanya, Shravya, Shreya, Gautam, Nishant, Gyanesh, and I, along with Sir, had a memorable stay at IUCAA (Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics). Our mission was twofold: testing the Celestron NexStar automated telescope atop IUCAA's terrace and taking Horn Antenna readings at different levels of the Milky Way galaxy.  

The evening began with delicious shawarma and parathas that fueled our excitement. As we worked late into the night, we joked, laughed, and shared stories. Nishant and I became the targets of friendly banter while creating the National Space Day presentations—it was all in good humor and added a spark of camaraderie to the tasks at hand.  

The night sky was mesmerizing. With the telescope, we observed Jupiter's bands and Galilean moons, a sight that never fails to inspire awe. The Horn Antenna readings gave us insight into the Milky Way’s structure, revealing peaks of radio emissions from regions of dense hydrogen clouds.  

As dawn approached, we wrapped up our tasks and prepared for the next day. By morning, I had to report to the office by 10 AM. While my friends were dropped at the SPPU Gate to catch the bus back to college, Sir and I grabbed a quick breakfast before I headed off to work.  

**Astronomy Fact:**  
Our Horn Antenna observations highlighted the importance of studying the Milky Way's hydrogen line (21 cm wavelength). This emission, caused by the hyperfine transition in hydrogen atoms, allows astronomers to map the galaxy's spiral arms and understand its dynamics—a reminder of how every wavelength offers a unique perspective of the cosmos.  

This experience wasn't just about work; it was about bonding, learning, and embracing the magic of the universe. Nights like these remind me why I fell in love with astronomy.
