description: BMC Cracked and The day I got Internship

**Date:** 01 December 2023

**Title:** Triumphs and Reflections

Today was a whirlwind of emotions and achievements. Amidst the chaos of end semester exams and assessments, a beam of light shone through—I secured an internship at BMC Software! The thrill of this accomplishment was beyond words. 🌟

I immediately reached out to my parents to share the news. The joy in my father's eyes when he heard was priceless, and he couldn't wait for me to tell my mother. Both of them were overwhelmed with happiness, and their support meant everything to me. ❤️

Sharing the news with my friends was an unforgettable experience. Tayyab, my classmate and confidant, was ecstatic, spreading the word like wildfire. Kartik, Sanket, and Prasad joined in, their excitement matching mine. But Bhavya, my friend and companion through the interview process, couldn't contain his joy despite not making it through himself. His happiness for me was deeply touching. 🎉

The celebration continued with my hostel mates, Chaitanya and Anuj, organizing a delightful surprise. Sweets, snacks, and an impromptu hostel party ensued—a celebration to cherish. The genuine happiness from everyone around me made the day even more special. 🏠✨

Yet, as the night settled in, questions gnawed at my soul. Why me? Were there others more deserving? Did I snatch this opportunity? Mixed emotions flooded in—joy for my success, but sorrow for those who didn't make it. 😔

Seeking solace, I turned to Ganapati Bappa, hoping for clarity. But the answers eluded me. With a heart seeking understanding, I prayed for guidance and wisdom from Lord Ganesha. 🙏

Today was a day of triumph and reflection, leaving me with a blend of gratitude, joy, and introspection.

Good night, dear diary. 🌙

Warm regards,
**With Dev-ish spirit,**
