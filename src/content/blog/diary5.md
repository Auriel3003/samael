description: BMC Cracked and The day I got Internship

**Date:** 01 December 2023

**Title:** Triumphs and Reflections

Today was one hell of a rollercoaster. End sem exams had me drowning, but amidst the academic chaos, a ray of light broke through—I snagged an internship at **BMC Software**. The rush I felt was indescribable. 🌟

I hit up my folks pronto to spill the beans. Dad was stoked, urging me to loop in Mom. Both were bursting with joy, their support hitting me in the feels. ❤️

Spreading the news among my buddies was intense. **Tayyab**, my trusted friend, went all out broadcasting it. **Kartik, Sanket,** and **Prasad** were hyped, matching my vibe. **Bhavya**, my partner-in-crime during interviews, didn't make it, but his happiness for my win hit differently—almost got me feeling emotional. 🎉

Hostel life turned into a mini rave. **Chaitanya and Anuj** threw party of sweets and snacks for a surprise bash. We partied hard, the genuine happiness around me making it an epic night. 🏠✨

But then, as the night crept in, doubts clawed at me. ***Why me? Were others more deserving? Did I steal this chance? Mixed emotions—my success brought joy, but their misses hit hard.*** 😔

Turned to Ganapati Bappa, seeking answers. No luck. Prayed for clarity from Lord Ganesha, but clarity eluded me. 🙏

Today was a mix of victory and contemplation, leaving me with a blend of gratitude, joy, and self-reflection.

Signing off for now, Diary. 🌙

Catch you later,
