# A Day of Achievements and Bonds

**Date: 28th May**  

Today was a day filled with both anticipation and fulfillment. It began with preparations for the EDI presentation and the much-anticipated NAAC visit. Last night, I faced a minor hiccup with the satellite finder not working. Thankfully, Gautam managed to bring a replacement, which worked perfectly.  

I carried all my components to the directed room, meticulously arranging my radio telescope to capture readings from various angles. Using Arduino, I recorded the data and visualized it through its plotter, which generated a clear and insightful graph at the last moment. Despite the time crunch, everything fell into place beautifully. The judge seemed genuinely impressed with my work and even took interest in my passion for analog communications and radiowaves. It felt rewarding to see my effort recognized and my interests appreciated.  

Later in the day, I joined Lavanya, Rushikesh, Piyush, and Shreyas in the reading room to prepare for the NAAC committee's arrival. Although the committee didn’t show up, the time spent with them was nothing short of memorable. We shared laughter, stories, and a sense of camaraderie that made the day even more special. It felt like a passing of the torch, as Antariksh stood ready to be handed over to new shoulders.  

**Astronomy Fact:**  
During my telescope readings, I was reminded of how radio telescopes, like the one I used, have been pivotal in unraveling mysteries of the cosmos. For example, the discovery of pulsars—highly magnetized rotating neutron stars emitting beams of electromagnetic radiation—was made using radio waves. Observations like these highlight how radio astronomy bridges the unseen and the known, unlocking the secrets of the universe.  

This day was a blend of challenges, achievements, and cherished moments, leaving me inspired to explore even further.
