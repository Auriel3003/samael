# A Journey from Idea to Reality, Presented at ICCUBEA PUNE-2023

🌟 **Breaking News: Innovating for Safety - One Device, Countless Possibilities 🌟**

On the 19th of August 2023, I had the immense privilege of presenting our groundbreaking project, "**Safety with Technology: a smart SOS Device**," at the prestigious 7th International Conference on “Computing, Communication, Control and Automation” (**ICCUBEA PUNE-2023**). This remarkable event, sponsored by **Capgemini** and hosted at the esteemed **Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCOE PUNE)**, marked a significant milestone in our journey.

What began as a mere idea during our **S.Y.B.Tech** journey has now evolved into a portable marvel powered by **Raspberry Pi**, boasting a **GPS module**, **camera**, **push buttons**, and other cutting-edge actuators. This device represents a giant leap towards enhancing personal safety through the ingenious integration of **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Computer Networks**. 🌐📡📷

First and foremost, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my exceptional team members, **Chanchal Rathad** and **SHAIKH TAYYAB**, for their unwavering dedication and relentless hard work, which have transformed our vision into a tangible reality. 👏💼🛠️

I must also acknowledge and express my deepest appreciation to our incredible project guide, **Dr. Sangita Kurundkar ma'am**, whose unwavering support, guidance, and expertise have been instrumental in turning our dream into a reality. I extend my utmost respect to all the dedicated faculty members in the **Electronics and Telecommunication (EnTC) Department** at **Vishwakarma Institute Of Technology (VIT)**, led by the illustrious **Prof. Dr. Shripad Bhatlawande Sir**. Your mentorship has been invaluable. 🙏🎓🔬

Special thanks go to **Jameer Manur Sir**, another invaluable mentor whose insights have propelled us to new heights in our project. Your support and wisdom have been truly instrumental. 🌟💡🔝

I would also like to express my gratitude to my friends, **Bhavya Shah**, **Sandesh Bagmare**, and **Samiksha Gurakhe**, whose invaluable insights and diverse perspectives have contributed significantly to the collaborative success of this project. 👥💬🤝

The conference itself was a remarkable experience, providing us with invaluable feedback and thought-provoking questions from the audience, such as:
🔹 How can we make it more cost-effective?
🔹 Can we embed it anywhere?
🔹 Should we consider replacing it with mobile apps?
🔹 How does it stand out from other methods of personal safety?

These questions have added a new dimension to our project, prompting us to consider fresh perspectives as we continue to refine and innovate. 💭💡🚀

I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude to **ICCUBEA PUNE-2023** for this fantastic opportunity and the thoughtful Conference Kit, which includes a calendar, notepad, Luxor Pen, school bag adorned with ICCUBEA and PCCOEP branding, delegate ID, and certificate. 📅📝👜🏅

This journey has been nothing short of incredible, and I am thrilled to continue pushing the boundaries of technology and personal safety. To my friends, family, mentors, and everyone who has supported us on this path, your encouragement means the world to me. 🌍🙌
