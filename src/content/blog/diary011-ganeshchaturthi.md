# Homecoming for BAPPA 

Finally, the much-awaited day arrived, though not without its hiccups. My train was delayed by three hours, and I reached home at 8 a.m. instead of the planned 5 a.m. Despite the delay, the morning was filled with anticipation as we prepared to welcome Ganpati Bappa into our home. The joyous atmosphere during the pooja made the journey worthwhile.

However, there was a bittersweet note to the day. Shreedhar Dada, my elder brother, had met with an accident and was severely injured. Seeing him participate, despite his bandaged state, was both comforting and heart-wrenching. I prayed earnestly to Ganpati Bappa, asking for his blessings to heal Dada and bring prosperity to our family.

The next day, I had to pack up and return to Pune to resume my routine in the demanding corporate world. As a newcomer to the startup culture, each day is a lesson in perseverance. But for now, I hold onto the warmth and divine energy of the day, hoping it carries me through the challenges ahead.

### Astronomy Fact:
Interestingly, Ganesh Chaturthi often coincides with the waxing crescent moon phase. This phase symbolizes growth and positivityâ€”apt for invoking Ganpati, the deity of new beginnings. Astronomically, the crescent moon is visible in the western sky just after sunset, a beautiful reminder of light emerging from darkness.
