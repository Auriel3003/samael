# Night Under Stars @11,12 May'24

*11th-12th May 2024*  

What an unforgettable adventure these past two days have been! Our star party, which began in high spirits, turned into a tale of surprises and wonders. Bhavya, Sir, Neelufar Ma’am, and I were on our way to the campsite, filled with laughter and excitement. However, uncalled-for rains halted our journey as the road became impassable. We parked our car near the serene Temghar Lake, unsure of what the night ahead would bring. Little did we know, it would be magical.  

As dusk fell, the rain subsided, and the surrounding darkness came alive with the soft glow of countless fireflies. The sight was enchanting—a natural symphony of light dancing across the night. It felt as if the universe had conspired to replace our temporary inconvenience with an extraordinary gift.  

Later, we reached CampHideout, where we experienced something new and delightful: staying in cozy pods that felt like tiny sanctuaries in the wilderness. Under the velvety night sky, the telescope revealed its treasures. One by one, we observed constellations—Scorpius, Centaurus, Sagittarius, Aquila, Ursa Minor, and Ursa Major. Bright stars like Vega shone brilliantly, and the constellation Cygnus seemed to stretch its wings gracefully across the heavens. Hercules dazzled us with its cluster, each star a glimmering jewel.  

We even spotted six satellites traversing the sky like silent messengers of human ingenuity against nature's canvas. Each moment of observation reminded me of how vast and intricate the cosmos is.  

**Astronomy Fact:**  
While observing the constellation Hercules, we viewed its prominent globular cluster, Messier 13 (M13). This cluster, also called the Great Hercules Cluster, contains over 300,000 stars bound together by gravity, a celestial spectacle located around 22,000 light-years from Earth. It is a beautiful reminder that even stars, scattered across the universe, can form tight-knit communities, bound by invisible forces.  

As we lay beneath the stars, immersed in their stories and beauty, I realized this night had gifted us more than just observations. It gave us an experience of wonder, connection, and the profound humility that comes from gazing into the infinite.
