# Engineering Meets Astronomy: Symbi-Lectures

**Diary Entry**  
**Date: 1st August**  

Today was an inspiring and fulfilling day. Jameer sir and I embarked on an exciting journey to Symbiosis College of Engineering on his bike, where we were invited to deliver a lecture on "Engineering and Astronomy." The warmth of the reception we received upon arrival, especially from our dear friend Devarshi and the Mechanical Engineering department, instantly made us feel at home.  

The lecture itself was a memorable experience. We spoke passionately about the intersection of engineering and astronomy, covering intriguing topics like optics, data analysis, the critical role of instrumentation in advancing astronomical research, and the marvels of observatories and telescopes across different wavelengths. It was heartening to see the audience so engaged, their curiosity sparking thoughtful questions and lively discussions.  

Towards the end, we were honored with a token of appreciation from the Head of the Mechanical Department—a moment that truly humbled me. The gesture reminded me of the importance of sharing knowledge and the bonds formed through collaboration.  

As I reflect on the day, I feel a profound sense of gratitude for the opportunity to contribute, even in a small way, to inspiring future engineers and astronomers.  

**Astronomy Fact:**  
The most distant telescope observations reveal galaxies from when the universe was just a few hundred million years old—less than 5% of its current age. Such discoveries are made possible by instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope, which uses infrared imaging to peer through cosmic dust and unveil the early history of our universe.
